Sing Pomodoro - Pomodoro tracking, statistics and accountability

To use:

1. bin/pomodoro [action] [people]
OR: 
POST to http://sing-pomodoro.heroku.com/<action>/<urlencode(people)>

People is formatted as follows:

"My Name <my@email.address>"

You can pass multiple people by seperating them with commas. Note that we don't show email addresses on the website, just the name you supply.

Action can be:

start - Start a pomodoro
finish - Finish a pomodoro. If a pomodoro is finished less than 25 minutes then it counts as failed.
interrupt - Register an interrupt. Currently this just increments a counter.

For example:

bin/pomodoro start "My Name <my@email.address>"
bin/pomodoro finish "My Name <my@email.address>"

2. View the result at http://sing-pomodoro.heroku.com

The output is pretty basic so far: ideas for stats welcome!

To use the pomodoro timer app for OSX:

1. Open preferences
2. Click script
3. Check the box next to the following events and put in the following:

start:
do shell script "~/path/to/bin/pomodoro start \"$pomodoroName\""

interrupt:
do shell script "~/path/to/bin/pomodoro interrupt \"$pomodoroName\""

reset:
do shell script "~/path/to/bin/pomodoro finish \"$pomodoroName\""

end:
do shell script "~/path/to/bin/pomodoro finish \"$pomodoroName\""
